\chapter{Introduction}
%The aim of our project is to give users a unique virtual experience of walking around their own designed homes in 3d. this will be  accomplished by using the existing in-built smart device sensors. A feature that is accessible in almost every modern smart device will be used - the gyroscope (along with other sensors that might compliment the product). Users will be able to experience their preferred designs in a 3d environment, being able to explore it with an additional feeling of Immersion.
%With a fast and busy lifestyle, it is hard not to think about time efficiency, especially with the tasks that people do not want to spend too much of their resources on. This is why it is important to establish pleasant experiences. The application that will be developed will help people to save not only time but expenses too. 
The navigation-application will be developed with a focus on a pleasant user experience and intuitive navigation. As such we will be attempting several non-traditional interaction methods and through focus groups evaluate which methods provide the user with the most intuitive experience.
 
\section{Initial Problem Statement}
How can we improve user experience in an interior design app using non-traditional mobile sensors?
