\chapter{Introduction}
The aim of our project is to give users a unique virtual experience of walking around their own designed homes in 3d. We will accomplish this by using the existing in-built smart device sensors. A feature that is accessible in almost every modern smart device will be used - gyroscope (along with other sensors that might compliment the product). Users will be able to experience their preferred designs in a 3d environment, being able to explore it with an additional feeling of Immersion.
\subsection{Introduction the Problem Area}
With the fast and busy lifestyle, it is hard not to think about time efficiency, especially with the tasks that people do not want to spend too much of their resources on. This is why it is important to establish pleasant experiences. Application that we will try to develope will help people to save not only time but expenses too.  
\section{Initial Problem Statement}
How can we improve user experience in interior design-centered appâ€™s 3d environment using non-traditional mobile sensors?
